@article{Triebel2006,
abstract = {To operate outdoors or on non-flat surfaces, mobile robots need appropriate data structures that provide a compact representation of the environment and at the same time support important tasks such as path planning and localization. One such representation that has been frequently used in the past are elevation maps which store in each cell of a discrete grid the height of the surface in the corresponding area. Whereas elevation maps provide a compact representation, they lack the ability to represent vertical structures or even multiple levels. In this paper, we propose a new representation denoted as multi-level surface maps (MLS maps). Our approach allows to store multiple surfaces in each cell of the grid. This enables a mobile robot to model environments with structures like bridges, underpasses, buildings or mines. Additionally, they allow to represent vertical structures. Throughout this paper we present algorithms for updating these maps based on sensory input, to match maps calculated from two different scans, and to solve the loop-closing problem given such maps. Experiments carried out with a real robot in an outdoor environment demonstrate that our approach is well-suited for representing large-scale outdoor environments},

@article{Hornung2013a,
annote = {The paper evaluates the 3D representations based on the flexibility of size of mapped area and resolution, accuracy, robustness (sensor noise), updability and memory efficiency.
        
The map itself is a collection of octrees and it is created using a probabilistic occupancy approach. This approach is used to smooth the effects of the noise generated by laser-range sensors ( main application). 
        
 One difference of this type of map is the explicity representation of free, occupied and unknown areas. The differentiation between free and unmapped areas allows a better representation of the space for mobile robots aplications, with the major importance in the colision avoidance tasks.
        
The octomap is a multi-resolution map and, therefore, has a better memory-efficiency than point clouds and rigids grids maps and can represent arbirtrary 3D environments, in comparsion wiht elevation and multi-levels surface maps. Similar or identical nodes can be pruned and therefore reduce the size of the map and memory consumption.
        
The three is constructed from cubes (voxels) and each cube can be subdivided in eight children. Each child can be recursively subdivided or can be a leaf node. The number of subdivision has a direct effect in the resolution (voxel size) of the map and it is possible to trunckate the map with multiple resolutions.
        
Each voxel is populated following a probabilistic rule and it has a probabilty of been occupied (or empty) and is considered occupied when a threshold is reached. An additional update formula is used and a voxel is updated only if it state is observed different from the antecessor state a number of times equal to the time that the voxel remained in that state. A limitation of sequential times can be added to better fit the algorithm to dynamic environments. Ray casting is used to obtain the occupied end point and the nodes in between the source and the endpoint are considered as free space. This method has a high computacional cost and is a bottleneck of the octomap framework (It is possible to disable this feature and improve the speed of data acquisition).
        
The map exploits hierachical dependencies in the environment and also enables that identical neighbors voxel to be pruned, reducinng the memory-consumption.
        
"To reconstruct a map, only the location of the root node needs to be known. All other spatial relationships between the nodes are implicitly stored in the encoding"
